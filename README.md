# DASH elements

![Travis CI Build status badge](https://travis-ci.org/GoogleChrome/dash-elements.svg?branch=master)

Dash elements are a collection of implementations of common web UI patterns using modern web technologies like Custom Elements v1 and ESnext with a special focus on accessibility, performance and progressive enhancement. Their purpose is to be an educational resource. Users are supposed to read their implementation rather than just using the elements.

## Demos

You can run the demos locally, after you build them:

```
npm install  # if you haven't already
npm run build
python -m SimpleHTTPServer  # or your favourite local server
```

In your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` (or the port that you're running the local server from.)

## Testing

Tests are written using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/). Each component has tests.

### Local

Tests run using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/config/browsers.html). Run the tests with

```
$ npm test
```

This assumes that Chrome, Firefox and Safari are installed as the tests run in all of these browser (using the [Custom Elements v1 Polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements)).

### Local + Docker (or Travis)

Tests can also run in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container (as we do on Travis):

```
$ npm run docker
```

This builds a docker image `googlechrome/dash-elements` and runs it. The dockerized tests use Chrome only.

## Staging

All branches and PRs are built and uploaded on Travis CI. The staged version can be viewed at `https://dash-elements.surma.link/<commit hash>`.
